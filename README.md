# Supercompilation notes

This repository contains some stuff I worked on while reading supercompiler
papers. Notably, it has a nice and clean implementation of Termination
Combinators Forever (2009, Peyton-Jones & Bolingbroke). Inevitably I'll get
around to finishing a sketch of Supercompilation by Evaluation, too (or not.)
